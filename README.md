# Inspiration ✨

Current metaverse platforms have following limitation:

### Entry-Barrier:

Entry cost is prohibitively expensive in current metaverse platforms.Even for hosting events you have to rent or buy land.

### Invite-Only Events:

Current metaverses do not allow users to host invite-only events as a result use-cases of metaverse drop significantly.

### Fast On Chain Payment:

We used Meter EVM to accomplish this.
